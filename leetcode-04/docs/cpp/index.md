# Solutions to LeetCode in C++

In the C/C++ community, codes are often messy and difficult to read.

Since I have a neat compulsive disorder, I decided to format all codes by `clang-format` as following:

- `.clang-format`

    ```
    Language:               Cpp
    BasedOnStyle:           Google
    IndentWidth:            4
    DerivePointerAlignment: false
    PointerAlignment:       Left
    AccessModifierOffset:   -4
    ```

Reading neat codes is a great pleasure in life!
