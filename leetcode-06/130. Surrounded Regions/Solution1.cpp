// Description:
// Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

// A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

// Example:
// X X X X
// X O O X
// X X O X
// X O X X

// After running your function, the board should be:
// X X X X
// X X X X
// X X X X
// X O X X

// Explanation:
// Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
// Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
// Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
